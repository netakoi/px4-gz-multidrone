# px4-gz-multidrone
Repository for PX4-ROS-Gazebo SITL Simulator \
This repository is created for personal research and for testing control algorithms. \
For low-levle PX4 offboard control algorithm with safety filter, please refer to another repository: https://github.com/mhcho1994/px4_ros_autopilot. 
For original repository with recent versions of PX4, GZ, Gazebo-Ignition, \
please refer to the following link: https://github.com/kpant14/px4-gz-docker. \

### Build the dockerfile and launch simulation environment
Note that this is not the finalized version of the container for SITL.
The current version uses the classic Gazebo, it will be replaced to the ignition Gazebo soon.

1. To get the sources required (run only once in the first time),

```bash
source ./script/get_src.sh
```

2. To build the dockerfile as an image or run the container (the command will build the image if the container does not exist), 

```bash
source run_dev.sh
```

3. To enter into the container,

```bash
docker exec -u user -it drones bash
```
you can use terminator instead of the bash terminal.

4. Build PX4-Autopilot inside the container,
(Check you are inside the container as user id 'user')

```bash
cd px4 && make px4_sitl
```

Run command below to launch a single drone simulation.

```bash
./Tools/simulation/gazebo-classic/sitl_multiple_run.sh -n 1 -m iris
```

(Temporal)
```bash
docker exec -u user -it jw_practice bash
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
MicroXRCEAgent udp4 -p 8888
./Tools/simulation/gazebo-classic/sitl_multiple_run.sh -n 1 -m iris
```
